## Overview
The **[S&P 500 Investment Simulator](https://ajay-sharma.shinyapps.io/InvestmentSimulator/)** is an interactive Shiny web application designed to explore historical S&P 500 data and simulate portfolio growth based on customizable investment parameters. The app provides insights into historical trends, multi-year returns, and portfolio outcomes using Monte Carlo simulations, helping users make data-driven investment decisions.

## Features

### Historical Data Exploration
- Visualize daily closing prices of the S&P 500 for any time range between 1928 and 2023.
- Choose between **linear** and **logarithmic** scales to analyze trends and highlight growth rates.

### Multi-Year Returns Analysis
- Calculate annualized returns for user-defined intervals (e.g., 5 or 10 years).
- Display positive and negative return periods in an interactive bar chart.
- Optionally overlay statistical metrics like **mean**, **median**, and **standard deviation**.

### Monte Carlo Portfolio Simulation
- Simulate portfolio growth over a custom number of years with inputs for:
  - Initial investment amount.
  - Periodic contributions (e.g., monthly or yearly).
  - Average annual return and volatility.
  - Number of simulations and random seed for reproducibility.
- Visualize multiple portfolio trajectories to explore uncertainty and potential outcomes.

### Summary Statistics
- View key summary statistics for simulated portfolio outcomes, including:
  - Percentiles (10th, 25th, 75th, and 90th).
  - Median and mean.
  - Standard deviation for assessing portfolio risk.

### Mathematical Definitions
- Review detailed formulas used in the app (e.g., portfolio growth, cumulative distribution function, and standard deviation) under the **Definitions** tab.
